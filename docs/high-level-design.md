# High-Level Design (HLD)

## System Architecture

### 1. Overview

The AI-Powered User Journey Analytics Tool is a client-side web application that transforms user-drawn journey diagrams into actionable analytics specifications through AI analysis.

### 2. Core Components

### 4. Key Architectural Decisions

#### 4.1 Client-Side Architecture

- **Decision**: Pure client-side implementation
- **Rationale**:
  - Reduced infrastructure costs
  - Better data privacy (no server-side data storage)
  - Simplified deployment
  - Direct AI API integration

#### 4.2 Multi-AI Provider Support

- **Decision**: Support multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Gemini, Claude)
- **Rationale**:
  - Redundancy and fallback options
  - Cost optimization based on provider pricing
  - Different models excel at different tasks
  - Future-proofing against API changes

#### 4.3 React Context for State Management

- **Decision**: Use React Context instead of external state management
- **Rationale**:
  - Lightweight for current complexity
  - No additional dependencies
  - Sufficient for current use case
  - Easy to migrate to Redux/Zustand if needed

#### 4.4 tldraw for Drawing Canvas

- **Decision**: Use tldraw library for drawing interface
- **Rationale**:
  - Production-ready drawing capabilities
  - Excellent TypeScript support
  - Extensible and customizable
  - Active development and community

### 5. System Boundaries

#### 5.1 In Scope

- Drawing interface for user journey creation
- AI analysis of drawings
- Event specification generation
- Configuration management
- Export functionality

#### 5.2 Out of Scope (Future Phases)

- Real-time collaboration
- Server-side storage
- Advanced analytics visualization
- Integration with specific analytics platforms
- User authentication

### 6. Technology Stack Justification

| Technology       | Purpose        | Justification                                                   |
| ---------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| React 18         | UI Framework   | Modern, well-supported, excellent TypeScript integration        |
| TypeScript       | Type Safety    | Reduces bugs, better developer experience, easier refactoring   |
| Vite             | Build Tool     | Fast development, excellent TypeScript support, modern bundling |
| tldraw           | Drawing Canvas | Mature drawing library, extensible, great TypeScript support    |
| Tailwind CSS     | Styling        | Utility-first, consistent design, rapid development             |
| Multiple AI APIs | AI Analysis    | Provider redundancy, cost optimization, capability diversity    |

### 7. Performance Considerations

#### 7.1 Drawing Performance

- Optimized canvas rendering through tldraw

#### 7.2 AI Processing

- Async processing with loading states
- Fallback mechanisms for failed API calls
- Token limit management for large drawings

#### 7.3 Memory Management

- Cleanup of drawing snapshots
- Efficient JSON serialization
- Browser storage optimization

### 8. Security Considerations

#### 8.1 API Key Security

- Client-side storage in localStorage
- No transmission to external servers
- User-controlled key management

#### 8.2 Data Privacy

- No server-side data storage
- Local processing only
- User controls all data export

### 9. Scalability Plan

#### Phase 1 (Current)

- Single-user, client-side application
- Basic AI analysis capabilities
- Manual configuration

#### Phase 2 (Future)

- Multi-user support
- Real-time collaboration
